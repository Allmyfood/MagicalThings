Magical Things add a few different items from swords to summons. Adds a dedicated boot slot, but still allows boots to be equipped. 
Useful for different kinds of boots. Still a work-in-progress. Bootslot equipped items don't show on player correctly.
Bootslot now has a configuration for the equipment pages and to allow shoes to be equipped in the non shoe slot. 
Equip boots with Right click, vanity boots with Shift Right click
Warning! Unequip your current boots from Bootslot before updating. Usually fine, but just in case.
