Magical Things add a few different items from swords to summons. Adds a dedicated boot slot, but still allows boots to be equipped. 
Useful for different kinds of boots. Still a work-in-progress. Shoe slot doesn't show on player correctly.
Shoe slot now has a configuration for the equipment pages and to allow shoes to be equipped in the non shoe slot. 
Equip shoes with Right click, vanity shoes with Shift Right click
Warning! Unequip your current shoes from shoe slot before updating. Usually fine, but just in case.
